## Abstract

The executor property rejected in 2021 returned in 2026 as a requirement. In 2021, the committee set aside the Networking TS; one stated deficiency was that its executors had no way to report a failure. In 2026, `std::execution::task` requires that the schedulers driving it lack any way to report a failure. The prohibition is the same in both. This paper traces the path from one to the other through the distinction between scheduling work and scheduling a continuation. P4094R1, P4095R1, and P4096R1 identified that distinction before P3941R4 established the infallibility requirement. P3941R4 confirms the framing analysis.

## 1. The Diagnosis

Two papers, six years apart, diagnosed the same deficiency in the executor model. In 2019, [P1525R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1525r0.pdf)<sup>[1]</sup> examined the one-way executor concept of the unified executors proposal<sup>[2]</sup>, whose basis operation accepted a callable and returned nothing:

```cpp
void execute(F&& f);
```

The first deficiency the paper named was error propagation. Errors arising during or after submission were handled, it observed, in an implementation-defined manner that varied from one executor to the next:

> "The implication is that no generic code can respond to asynchronous errors in a portable way."

In 2021, [P2464R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2464r0.html)<sup>[3]</sup>, written on behalf of the Finnish national body, applied the same standard to the Networking TS and identified three deficiencies. The first was the absence of an error channel. In October 2021, LEWG polled electronically on the Networking TS ([P2453R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2453r0.html)<sup>[4]</sup>). The poll on discontinuing the TS reached no consensus. A second poll on basing networking on the sender/receiver model reached weak consensus in favor, and the committee's asynchronous work moved toward P2300. The Networking TS was set aside, and a missing error channel led the list of reasons.

## 2. The Framing

Why was the missing channel a deficiency? [P4094R1](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4094r1.pdf)<sup>[5]</sup> documents that `execute(F&&)` replaced three older primitives (`dispatch`, `post`, and `defer`) that scheduled a continuation rather than submitting work. The replacement was the executor unification itself: P0443 reconciled the Networking TS executors descended from Kohlhoff's Asio with the parallel algorithms executors and collapsed both into a single `execute(F&&)`. The framing determines whether the missing channel is a defect. Two readings of the same signature follow. Under the work framing, the callable is a unit of work, the caller is still running, and a missing error channel strands any failure. Under the continuation framing, the callable is a resumption handle, the caller has suspended or returned, and no live caller is waiting to receive an error.

[P4095R1](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4095r1.pdf)<sup>[6]</sup> and [P4096R1](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p4096r1.pdf)<sup>[7]</sup> show that both P1525R0 and P2464R0 analyzed the operation under the work framing alone. P4094R1, P4095R1, and P4096R1 predate P3941R4. The continuation framing, Kohlhoff's original definition in [P0113R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0113r0.html)<sup>[8]</sup>, was already absent from the API surface when each paper was written.

P1525R0's own definition confirms the framing it assumed:

> "For the purpose of this document, by 'one-way execute,' we mean a void-returning function that accepts a nullary Invocable and eagerly submits it for execution on an execution agent that the executor creates for it."<sup>[1]</sup>

"Eagerly submits." "Execution agent that the executor creates." Both phrases describe submitting work to a newly created agent, not resuming a caller that has suspended. The continuation primitives that `execute` replaced (`dispatch`, `post`, `defer`) do not appear in P1525R0. [P0688R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0688r0.html)<sup>[9]</sup> had removed them from the API surface two years earlier, retaining the continuation semantics only as an optional `prefer(is_continuation)` hint. By the time P1525R0 analyzed the operation, the framing was documented in P0113R0 but no longer visible in the signature.

Under the continuation framing, an infallible scheduling operation is not a defect; it is what the caller's state requires. A suspended coroutine is not running to act on an error, so it does not need a channel to receive one.

Two readings of the missing channel are possible. In the first, the operation may need to report failure, but the API does not allow it. In the second, the operation never fails, and the API reflects that. Under the continuation framing, the distinction does not survive. A caller that has suspended cannot act on a failure regardless of whether one occurs.

## 3. The Return

The deficiency diagnosed in 2021 was resolved by the sender/receiver model. The resolution reintroduced the constraint.

The sender/receiver model, [P2300R10](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r10.html)<sup>[10]</sup>, shipped in C++26 as `std::execution`. [P3552R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3552r3.html)<sup>[11]</sup> added `task`, a coroutine type with one defining guarantee: scheduler affinity. After a `co_await`, a task resumes on the same scheduler on which it suspended. `task` implements the guarantee by wrapping every awaited expression in `affine_on` (since renamed `affine`), a sender adaptor that schedules the continuation back onto the task's scheduler.

That scheduling operation must not fail. [P3941R4](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p3941r4.html)<sup>[12]</sup> establishes the requirement:

> "If this scheduling operation fails, i.e., it completes with `set_error(e)`, or if it gets cancelled, i.e., it completes with `set_stopped()`, the execution agent on which the scheduling operation resumes is unclear and `affine_on` cannot guarantee its promise. Thus, it seems reasonable to require that a scheduler used with `affine_on` is infallible."

A scheduler used with `affine_on` may complete only with `set_value()`, not `set_error` or `set_stopped`. The scheduling operation that drives `task` has no way to report a failure.

## 4. The Coroutine Executor

A third executor, designed for coroutines, omits the same channels. [P4003R3](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P4003R3.pdf)<sup>[13]</sup> constrains the argument to `continuation`, a coroutine handle paired with an intrusive list pointer:

```cpp
std::coroutine_handle<> dispatch(
    continuation& c) const;

void post(continuation& c) const;
```

`dispatch` returns a handle for symmetric transfer, and `post` defers. Both accept a suspended coroutine and resume it on a context. Neither delivers a value.

## 5. The Symmetry

The shape of a scheduling operation is the profile of channels it offers the caller: error, cancellation, and value. Three executors, separated by a decade of committee work, share one shape.

| Property | P0443R14 Executor | Infallible Scheduler (P3941R4) | Coroutine Executor (P4003R3) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Error channel | None | None; `set_error` omitted | None after acceptance. `post` throws before. |
| Cancellation | None | None; `set_stopped` omitted | `destroy()` on the handle |
| Value delivered | None | None; `set_value()` nullary | None |
| Encoded in the type by | `void` return | Completion signatures | `continuation` argument type |
| Scope | Every executor | Schedulers used with `affine_on` | Every coroutine executor |
| Why the caller tolerates it | It has returned | It is suspended | It is suspended |

The match across three columns is not exact. P0443R14 required infallibility of every executor but omitted any such statement; the `void` return left no room to report a failure. P3941R4 requires infallibility of one scheduler in one role and states the requirement in the completion signatures. P4003R3 constrains the argument type to a coroutine handle, making infallibility a consequence of the continuation framing rather than a separate requirement. P4003R3's `post` can throw when it cannot accept the continuation, so its infallibility holds after acceptance rather than unconditionally.

The old constraint was universal and implicit. The new ones are narrow and explicit. That the committee chose to make the constraint explicit in P3941R4, where P0443R14 left it implicit, confirms that the constraint is recognized as correct for this role, not that it is a different constraint.

## 6. A Possible Objection

A possible objection distinguishes incapability from selective constraint. P0443R14's `void` return left no room for an error channel in any executor. P3941R4's completion signatures exclude `set_error` for one scheduler in one role, while the model retains the channel elsewhere. The distinction between incapability and selective constraint is real.

The distinction answers a question the paper does not ask. The question is not whether the model surrounding the operation improved; it did. The question is whether the scheduling operation changed its requirements; it did not. Both designs answer the same question: Should a continuation-scheduling operation report errors? Both answer no.

The objection treats P0443R14's `void` return as a limitation the operation inherited from the model. P1525R0 defined the operation as work submission. The `void` return matched the framing the authors assumed: not a limitation of the model, but a consequence of how they read the operation. Kohlhoff designed `dispatch`, `post`, and `defer` with no error channel because the caller had suspended. The `void` return encoded a judgment about the operation's role. P3941R4 encodes the same judgment in completion signatures; the encoding improved, and the judgment did not change.

If the objection is that P3941R4's infallibility is a deliberate design choice for a specific role, the objection grants the paper's claim. The role, scheduling a continuation onto an execution context, is the role `dispatch`, `post`, and `defer` filled. Choosing infallibility deliberately the second time acknowledges that the choice was available the first time; it does not rebut the claim.

## 7. The Shape

The shape of the scheduling operation follows from the state of the caller. A caller that is running needs an error channel; a caller that has suspended does not.

Two independent lines of work confirm this. The executor lineage runs from P0443R14 through P2300R10 to P3941R4. It discovered the shape through evolution: Each revision changed how the constraint was encoded, from `void` return to completion signatures, but the constraint survived every redesign. The coroutine executor in P4003R3 discovered the same shape from first principles of the coroutine model, without sender/receiver concepts and without completion signatures. The two derivations share no abstraction machinery. They converge because they share the caller's state.

Convergence from unrelated starting points eliminates the explanation that the shape is an artifact of any one model's expressiveness. The sender/receiver model did not produce the constraint; neither did the coroutine model. The caller's state produced it, and each model re-encoded what was already there. Kohlhoff's continuation-framed executor omitted the same three channels in Asio over two decades ago. P0113R0 documented it, but the design predates either model.

P4094R1, P4095R1, and P4096R1 identified the framing distinction before P3941R4 was written. P3941R4 confirmed it. *The committee rediscovered that continuations need a continuation-framed executor.*
